<h2>Impersonation</h2>
Pretext: Attackers construct false scenarios to manipulate victims.

Actors: The attackers play roles like "Wendy from Microsoft Windows" to deceive.

Scenarios: They create urgent situations, like computer check-ups or enforcement actions, to coerce victims.

Impersonation: Attackers pretend to be from legitimate organizations to gain trust.

Reconnaissance: They gather information about victims and their organizations to tailor their impersonation.

Techniques: Impersonators often pose as higher-ranking officials, use technical jargon, or feign friendliness to disarm victims.

Extraction: Once trust is established, attackers elicit information from victims, often through voice phishing or vishing.

Identity Theft: Personal details obtained are used for identity fraud, credit card fraud, bank account access, loan fraud, or government benefit fraud.

Protection: Individuals should safeguard personal information and avoid sharing it with unsolicited callers. 

Verification processes are essential, especially for individuals handling sensitive information.

<h2>Dumpster Diving</h2>

Dumpster diving: Gathering discarded personal info.

Legal in US unless local laws prohibit.

Secure garbage areas, shred documents to prevent access.

Review discarded items to safeguard against exploitation.


<h2>Shoulder Surfing</h2>

Shoulder surfing: Observing computer screens for sensitive info.

Happens in various settings, including airports.

Privacy filters block screen visibility from angles except for the user.

Position monitor away from windows or hallways to prevent.

Be aware of surroundings and take precautions.

<h2>Hoaxes</h2>

Definition: A situation that appears real but isn't, consuming time and resources.

Manifestation: Can occur through emails, messages, or voicemails.

Tactics: Hoaxes often involve soliciting money via gift card purchases.

Viruses and Malware Hoaxes: Some hoaxes falsely claim virus or malware infections.

Example: Received spam email promising $850,000, typical of hoaxes.

Response: Stay skeptical of unsolicited messages and verify information.

Resources: Websites like hoaxslayer.net and snopes.com help cross-reference hoaxes.

Spam Filter: Ensure spam filters are active to catch suspicious emails.

Warning Signs: If it sounds too good to be true, it likely is; avoid falling victim to hoaxes.

<h2>Watering Hole Attacks</h2>

Challenge: Stringent security measures thwart direct attacks on internal systems.

Strategy Shift: Attackers target third-party sites frequented by organization members.

Objective: Infect users visiting the "watering hole" site to gain access to the organization's network.

Research: Attackers identify sites visited by organization members; may infect local businesses or industrial sites.

Vulnerability: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities on third-party sites to infect visitors indiscriminately.

Example: In January 2017, financial authority websites in Poland, Mexico, and Uruguay were targeted.

Payload: Malicious JavaScript files downloaded to specific IP addresses associated with financial institutions.

Prevention: Employ layered security defenses and next-generation firewalls or intrusion prevention systems.

Defense Example: Symantec antivirus software detected and blocked JavaScript attacks on the Polish Financial Supervision Authority website.

Awareness: Stay vigilant against watering hole attacks, whether on internal or third-party sites.

<h2>Spam</h2>

Types: Commercial ads, non-commercial promotions, and phishing attempts are common.

Challenges: Security risks, resource utilization, and costs for spam management systems.

Examples: Phishing spam requests personal information, while unsolicited ads sell products.

Prevention Strategies:
Implement spam filters based on allowed lists and RFC compliance.
Use reverse DNS checks and tar pitting to deter spammers.
Employ recipient filtering to reject emails to non-existent addresses.
Approach: Combining techniques is essential for effective spam prevention.

<h2>Influence Campaigns</h2>

<h2>Principles of Social Engineering</h2>

Changing Landscape:

Social engineering attacks constantly evolve.

Collaborative Attacks:

Attacks may involve multiple individuals or organizations.
Automation and open source intelligence enhance effectiveness.
Psychological Techniques:

Attackers leverage psychological principles.
Examples include authority, intimidation, social proof, scarcity, urgency, familiarity, liking, and trust.
Real-Life Example:

Naoki Hiroshima's case illustrates social engineering tactics.
Attacker used PayPal and GoDaddy to gain control of domain names and extort Twitter username.
Twitter eventually returned the username to the original owner.
