<h2>Understand your stakeholders</h2>
A stakeholder is defined as an individual or group that has an interest in any decision or activity of an organization. A big part of what you’ll do as a security analyst is report your findings to various security stakeholders. 
<h2>Communicate for impact</h2>
Get to the point
Security stakeholders have roles and responsibilities that are time sensitive and impact the business. It’s important that any communications they receive, and the actions they need to take, are clear. To get to the point in your communications, ask yourself: 

What do I want this person to know? 

Why is it important for them to know it? 

When do they need to take action?

How do I explain the situation in a nontechnical manner?
