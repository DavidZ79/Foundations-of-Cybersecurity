<h2>The user interface</h2>

History file
For security analysts, using the Linux CLI is helpful because it records a history file of all the commands and actions in the CLI. If you were using a GUI, your actions are not necessarily saved in a history file.

For example, you might be in a situation where you’re responding to an incident using a playbook. The playbook’s instructions require you to run a series of different commands. If you used a CLI, you’d be able to go back to the history and ensure all of the commands were correctly used. This could be helpful if there were issues using the playbook and you had to review the steps you performed in the command line.

Additionally, if you suspect an attacker has compromised your system, you might be able to trace their actions using the history file.
