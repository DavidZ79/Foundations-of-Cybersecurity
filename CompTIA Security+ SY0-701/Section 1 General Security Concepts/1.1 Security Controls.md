Control Types:

- Preventative: Block access to a resource (you shall not pass!)
- Deterrent: Discourage an intrusion attempt (make attacker think twice)
- Detective: Identify and log an intrusion attempt (may or may not prevent access)
- Corrective: Apply a control AFTER event has been detected (fire extinguisher)
- Compensating: Existing controls aren't sufficient, temporary fix (backup power generator)
- Directive: Direct someone to security compliance (do this pls thx)
