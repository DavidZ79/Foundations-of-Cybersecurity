<h2>Introduction to networks</h2>

Network is a group of connected devices. IP and mac addresses help devices find each other.

LAN is local, LAN connects to internet.

WAN is worldwide.

Router: A network device that connects multiple networks together.

Modem: Connects a router to the internet and enables LAN internet access.

Switch: A device that sends and receives data between devices on a network.

Hub: A network device that broadcasts information to every device on the network.

Firewall: A network security device that monitors traffic to or from your network.

CSPs provide three main categories of services:

Software as a service (SaaS) refers to software suites operated by the CSP that a company can use remotely without hosting the software. 

Infrastructure as a service (Iaas) refers to the use of virtual computer components offered by the CSP. These include virtual containers and storage that are configured remotely through the CSP’s API or web console. Cloud-compute and storage services can be used to operate existing applications and other technology workloads without significant modifications. Existing applications can be modified to take advantage of the availability, performance, and security features that are unique to cloud provider services.

Platform as a service (PaaS) refers to tools that application developers can use to design custom applications for their company. Custom applications are designed and accessed in the cloud and used for a company’s specific business needs.

<h2>Network communication</h2>

Data packets: A basic unit of information that travels from one device to another within a network. Think of it as a piece of mail.

Header, Body, Footer

Bandwidth: amount of data a device receives a second.

TCP/IP Model, port numbers, four layers

<h2>Local and wide network communication</h2>

IPv4, IPv6. IPv6 is more modern (has 32 characters!!!)

MAC address: alphanumeric code for devices on a network. Uses data packets.



<h2>Glossary</h2>

Terms and definitions from Course 3, Module 1
Bandwidth: The maximum data transmission capacity over a network, measured by bits per second

Cloud computing: The practice of using remote servers, application, and network services that are hosted on the internet instead of on local physical devices

Cloud network: A collection of servers or computers that stores resources and data in remote data centers that can be accessed via the internet

Data packet: A basic unit of information that travels from one device to another within a network

Hub: A network device that broadcasts information to every device on the network

Internet Protocol (IP): A set of standards used for routing and addressing data packets as they travel between devices on a network

Internet Protocol (IP) address: A unique string of characters that identifies the location of a device on the internet

Local Area Network (LAN): A network that spans small areas like an office building, a school, or a home

Media Access Control (MAC) address: A unique alphanumeric identifier that is assigned to each physical device on a network

Modem: A device that connects your router to the internet and brings internet access to the LAN

Network: A group of connected devices

Open systems interconnection (OSI) model: A standardized concept that describes the seven layers computers use to communicate and send data over the network

Packet sniffing: The practice of capturing and inspecting data packets across a network

Port: A software-based location that organizes the sending and receiving of data between devices on a network

Router: A network device that connects multiple networks together

Speed: The rate at which a device sends and receives data, measured by bits per second

Switch: A device that makes connections between specific devices on a network by sending and receiving data between them

TCP/IP model: A framework used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across a network

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): An internet communication protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data

User Datagram Protocol (UDP): A connectionless protocol that does not establish a connection between devices before transmissions

Wide Area Network (WAN): A network that spans a large geographic area like a city, state, or country
