<h2>Flaws in the system</h2>

Vulnerabilities: a weakness that can be exploited by a threat

Exploits: see above

zero day exploit: previously unknown exploit

defense in depth: layered defence

Perimeter layer, like authentication systems that validate user access

Network layer, which is made up of technologies like network firewalls and others

Endpoint layer, which describes devices on a network, like laptops, desktops, or servers

Application layer, which involves the software that users interact with

Data layer, which includes any information that’s stored, in transit, or in use


Exposure: mistakes that can be exploited


CVE list

CVSS: vulnerability scoring

<h2>Identify system vulnerabilities</h2>

Vulnerability assessment: identification, vulnerability analysis, risk assessment, remediation

Penetration testing strategies
There are three common penetration testing strategies: 

Open-box testing is when the tester has the same privileged access that an internal developer would have—information like system architecture, data flow, and network diagrams. This strategy goes by several different names, including internal, full knowledge, white-box, and clear-box penetration testing.

Closed-box testing is when the tester has little to no access to internal systems—similar to a malicious hacker. This strategy is sometimes referred to as external, black-box, or zero knowledge penetration testing.

Partial knowledge testing is when the tester has limited access and knowledge of an internal system—for example, a customer service representative. This strategy is also known as gray-box testing.

Closed box testers tend to produce the most accurate simulations of a real-world attack. Nevertheless, each strategy produces valuable results by demonstrating how an attacker might infiltrate a system and what information they could access.

Becoming a penetration tester
Penetration testers are in-demand in the fast growing field of cybersecurity. All of the skills you’re learning in this program can help you advance towards a career in pen testing:

Network and application security

Experience with operating systems, like Linux

Vulnerability analysis and threat modeling

Detection and response tools

Programming languages, like Python and BASH

Communication skills

Programming skills are very helpful in penetration testing because it's often performed on software and IT systems. With enough practice and dedication, cybersecurity professionals at any level can develop the skills needed to be a pen tester.

Bug bounty programs
Organizations commonly run bug bounty programs which offer freelance pen testers financial rewards for finding and reporting vulnerabilities in their products. Bug bounties are great opportunities for amateur security professionals to participate and grow their skills. 

Pro tip: 
HackerOne
 is a community of ethical hackers where you can find active bug bounties to participate in.
