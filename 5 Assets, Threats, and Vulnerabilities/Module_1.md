<h2>Get started with the course</h2>



<h2>Introduction to assets</h2>

Assets, threats, and vulnerabilities

Risk, security risk planning, asset, threat, vulnerability

Security risk
Security plans are all about how an organization defines risk. However, this definition can vary widely by organization. As you may recall, a risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. Since organizations have particular assets that they value, they tend to differ in how they interpret and approach risk.

Likelihood x Impact = Risk

asset management, asset inventory, asset classification

<h2>Digital and physical assets</h2>

Data, states of data: data in use, data in transit, data at rest

Information Security: keeping data safe in all states

There are three main categories of cloud-based services:

Software as a service (SaaS)

Platform as a service (PaaS)

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

<h2>Risk and asset security</h2>

risk categories, policy, standards, procedures

security compliance

NIST cybersecurity framework CSF: core tiers profiles

Components of the CSF
As you might recall, the framework consists of three main components: the core, tiers, and profiles. In the following sections, you'll learn more about each of these CSF components.

Core
The CSF core is a set of desired cybersecurity outcomes that help organizations customize their security plan. It consists of five functions, or parts: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. These functions are commonly used as an informative reference to help organizations identify their most important assets and protect those assets with appropriate safeguards. The CSF core is also used to understand ways to detect attacks and develop response and recovery plans should an attack happen.

Tiers
The CSF tiers are a way of measuring the sophistication of an organization's cybersecurity program. CSF tiers are measured on a scale of 1 to 4. Tier 1 is the lowest score, indicating that a limited set of security controls have been implemented. Overall, CSF tiers are used to assess an organization's security posture and identify areas for improvement.

Profiles
The CSF profiles are pre-made templates of the NIST CSF that are developed by a team of industry experts. CSF profiles are tailored to address the specific risks of an organization or industry. They are used to help organizations develop a baseline for their cybersecurity plans, or as a way of comparing their current cybersecurity posture to a specific industry standard.

Note: The core, tiers, and profiles were each designed to help any business improve their security operations. Although there are only three components, the entire framework consists of a complex system of subcategories and processes.
