<h2>Incident detection and verification</h2>

Detection: prompt detection of security incidents

The power of crowdsourcing
Crowdsourcing is the practice of gathering information using public input and collaboration. Threat intelligence platforms use crowdsourcing to collect information from the global cybersecurity community. Traditionally, an organization's response to incidents was performed in isolation. A security team would receive and analyze an alert, and then work to remediate it without additional insights on how to approach it. Without crowdsourcing, attackers can perform the same attacks against multiple organizations.

<h2>Response and recovery</h2>

Site resilience 
Resilience is the ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disruptions. Organizations can design their systems to be resilient so that they can continue delivering services despite facing disruptions. An example is site resilience, which is used to ensure the availability of networks, data centers, or other infrastructure when a disruption happens. There are three types of recovery sites used for site resilience:

Hot sites: A fully operational facility that is a duplicate of an organization's primary environment. Hot sites can be activated immediately when an organization's primary site experiences failure or disruption.

Warm sites: A facility that contains a fully updated and configured version of the hot site. Unlike hot sites, warm sites are not fully operational and available for immediate use but can quickly be made operational when a failure or disruption occurs.

Cold sites: A backup facility equipped with some of the necessary infrastructure required to operate an organization's site. When a disruption or failure occurs, cold sites might not be ready for immediate use and might need additional work to be operational.
<h2>Post-incident actions</h2>
Final report:

Executive summary: A high-level summary of the report including the key findings and essential facts related to the incident

Timeline:  A detailed chronological timeline of the incident that includes timestamps dating the sequence of events that led to the incident

Investigation: A compilation of the actions taken during the detection and analysis of the incident. For example, analysis of a network artifact such as a packet capture reveals information about what activities happen on a network.

Recommendations: A list of suggested actions for future prevention
