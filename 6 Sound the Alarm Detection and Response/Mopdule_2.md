IPv4 is the most commonly used version of IP. There are thirteen fields in the header:

Version: This field indicates the IP version. For an IPv4 header, IPv4 is used. 

Internet Header Length (IHL): This field specifies the length of the IPv4 header including any Options.

Type of Service (ToS): This field provides information about packet priority for delivery.

Total Length: This field specifies the total length of the entire IP packet including the header and the data.

Identification: Packets that are too large to send are fragmented into smaller pieces. This field specifies a unique identifier for fragments of an original IP packet so that they can be reassembled once they reach their destination.

Flags: This field provides information about packet fragmentation including whether the original packet has been fragmented and if there are more fragments in transit.

Fragment Offset: This field is used to identify the correct sequence of fragments.

Time to Live (TTL): This field limits how long a packet can be circulated in a network, preventing packets from being forwarded by routers indefinitely.

Protocol: This field specifies the protocol used for the data portion of the packet.

Header Checksum: This field specifies a checksum value which is used for error-checking the header.

Source Address: This field specifies the source address of the sender.

Destination Address: This field specifies the destination address of the receiver.

Options: This field is optional and can be used to apply security options to a packet.

IPv6 adoption has been increasing because of its large address space. There are eight fields in the header:

Version: This field indicates the IP version. For an IPv6 header, IPv6 is used.

Traffic Class: This field is similar to the IPv4 Type of Service field. The Traffic Class field provides information about the packet's priority or class to help with packet delivery.

Flow Label: This field identifies the packets of a flow. A flow is the sequence of packets sent from a specific source. 

Payload Length: This field specifies the length of the data portion of the packet.

Next Header: This field indicates the type of header that follows the IPv6 header such as TCP.

Hop Limit: This field is similar to the IPv4 Time to Live field. The Hop Limit limits how long a packet can travel in a network before being discarded.

Source Address: This field specifies the source address of the sender.

Destination Address: This field specifies the destination address of the receiver.

<h2>Packet Inspection</h2>

tcpdump: command line tool network analyzer


A network protocol analyzer (packet sniffer) is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network.

Packet sniffing is the practice of capturing and inspecting data packets across a network.
